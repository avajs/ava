# Execution Context (`t` argument)

Translations: [FranÃ§ais](https://github.com/avajs/ava-docs/blob/main/fr_FR/docs/02-execution-context.md)

Each test or hook is called with an execution context. By convention it's named `t`.

```js
import test from 'ava';

test('my passing test', t => {
	t.pass();
});
```

Each test or hook receives a different object. It contains the [assertions](./03-assertions.md) as well as the methods and properties listed below.

## `t.title`

The test title.

## `t.context`

Contains shared state from hooks.

## `t.passed`

When used in `test.afterEach()` or `test.afterEach.always()` hooks this tells you whether the test has passed. When used in a test itself (including teardown functions) this remains `true` until an assertion fails, the test has ended with an error, or a teardown function caused an error. This value has no meaning in other hooks.

## `t.log(...values)`

Log values contextually alongside the test result instead of immediately printing them to `stdout`. Behaves somewhat like `console.log`, but without support for placeholder tokens.

## `t.plan(count)`

Plan how many assertions there are in the test. The test will fail if the actual assertion count doesn't match the number of planned assertions. See [assertion planning](./03-assertions.md#assertion-planning).

## `t.teardown(fn)`

Registers the `fn` function to be run after the test has finished. You can register multiple functions. They'll run in reverse order, so the last registered function is run first. You can use asynchronous functions: only one will run at a time.

You cannot perform assertions using the `t` object or register additional functions from inside `fn`.

You cannot use `t.teardown()` in hooks either.

## `t.timeout(ms)`

Set a timeout for the test, in milliseconds. The test will fail if this timeout is exceeded. The timeout is reset each time an assertion is made.
