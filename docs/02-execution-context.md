# Execution Context (`t` argument)

Translations: [Français](https://github.com/avajs/ava-docs/blob/master/fr_FR/docs/02-execution-context.md)

Each test or hook is called with an execution context. By convention it's named `t`.

```js
const test = require('ava');

test('my passing test', t => {
	t.pass();
});
```

Each test or hook receives a different object. It contains the [assertions](./03-assertions.md) as well as the methods and properties listed below.

## `t.title`

The test title.

## `t.context`

Contains shared state from hooks.

## `t.passed`

Whether a test has passed. This value is only accurate in the `test.afterEach()` and `test.afterEach.always()` hooks.

## `t.end()`

End the test. Only works with `test.cb()`.

## `t.log(...values)`

Log values contextually alongside the test result instead of immediately printing them to `stdout`. Behaves somewhat like `console.log`, but without support for placeholder tokens.

## `t.plan(count)`

Plan how many assertion there are in the test. The test will fail if the actual assertion count doesn't match the number of planned assertions. See [assertion planning](./03-assertions.md#assertion-planning).

## `t.teardown(fn)`

Registers the `fn` function to be run after the test has finished. You can register multiple functions and they'll run in order<sup>†</sup>. You can use asynchronous functions: only one will run at a time.

You cannot perform assertions using the `t` object or register additional functions from inside `fn`.

You cannot use `t.teardown()` in hooks either.

<sup>†</sup> In the next major release we'll change this so teardown functions run in reverse order. The last registered function will be called first. You can opt in to this behavior now by enabling the `reverseTeardowns` experiment.

**`package.json`**:

```json
{
	"ava": {
		"nonSemVerExperiments": {
			"reverseTeardowns": true
		}
	}
}
```

**`ava.config.js`**:

```js
export default {
	nonSemVerExperiments: {
		reverseTeardowns: true
	}
}
```

## `t.timeout(ms)`

Set a timeout for the test, in milliseconds. The test will fail if this timeout is exceeded. The timeout is reset each time an assertion is made.
