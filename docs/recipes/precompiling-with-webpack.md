## Precompiling source files with webpack

Translations: [Fran√ßais](https://github.com/avajs/ava-docs/blob/master/fr_FR/docs/recipes/precompiling-with-webpack.md)

The AVA [readme](https://github.com/avajs/ava#transpiling-imported-modules) mentions precompiling your imported modules as an alternative to runtime compilation, but it doesn't explain how. This recipe shows how to do this using webpack. (This example uses webpack 2.0)

###### webpack.config.js

```js
const nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals');

module.exports = {
	entry: ['src/tests.js'],
	target: 'node',
	output: {
		path: '_build',
		filename: 'tests.js'
	},
	externals: [nodeExternals()],
	module: {
		rules: [{
				test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
				use: 'babel-loader'
		}]
	}
};
```

The important bits are `target: 'node'`, which ignores Node.js-specific `require`s (e.g. `fs`, `path`, etc.) and `externals: nodeModules` which prevents webpack from trying to bundle external Node.js modules which it may choke on.

You can now run `$ ava _build/tests.js` to run the tests contained in this output.
