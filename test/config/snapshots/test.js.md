## pkg-conf(resolve-dir): works as expected when run from the package.json directory

> resolves test files from configuration

    [
      {
        file: 'dir-a/dir-a-base-1.js',
        title: 'test',

      {
        file: 'dir-a/dir-a-base-2.js',
        title: 'test',
      },

> resolves test files without configuration
