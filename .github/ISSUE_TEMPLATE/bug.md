Please provide details about:

* What you're trying to do
* What happened
* What you expected to happen

Please share relevant sample code. Or better yet, provide a link to a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

We'll also need your AVA configuration (in `package.json` or `ava.config.*` configuration files) and how you're invoking AVA. Share the installed AVA version (get it by running `npx ava --version`).
