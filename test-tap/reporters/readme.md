# Upgrade reporter test
There are separate log-files for every supported 
major node version.
To upgrade to a new major node version, install 
the new node version with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md),
and run `npm run test`.
This command creates a new set of log-files, that
you should add to the git repository.
